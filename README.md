# Snake Java 2D Game

This is a simple Java 2D Snake game with sound based on the Java 2G graphics library. The game has three different levels (Easy, Normal, and Hard).

The used IDE is Eclipse (I uploaded all project artifacts), also the game JAR file is uploaded.

If you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so :)
