# Snake Java 2D Game

This is a simple Java 2D Snake game using Threads and Java Swing to display the game. The game has three different levels (Easy, Normal, and Hard).

The used IDE is netbeans (I uploaded all project artifacts), also the game JAR file is uploaded.

If you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so :)
